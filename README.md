## Delivery Trip Workflow Demo

This example models a basic delivery trip workflow -- driving to pickup location, item pickup, driving to destination, handing off or dropping off the item, payment.

The definition of the workflow can be found in [lib/rs/trip/graph.ex](./lib/rs/trip/graph.ex), and the example below illustrates running an execution of this workflow, which gets created once the driver and the order get matched.

The workflow is built with [Journey](https://hexdocs.pm/journey), an Elixir package for defining and executing Persisted Distributed Reactive Graphs, so I didn't need to write much code for
* persistence (db schemas),
* scheduling one-time and recurring tasks,
* orchestrating conditional events and dependencies,
* structuring the code of orchestration logic and computations,
* retries and crash recovery,
* distribution and horizontal scalability,

while keeping the application concise, self-documented (see the graph), and naturally scalable â€“ resilient, durable executions in a package. When / if we wire up LiveView UI for managing trips, we can use Journey's [f_on_save](https://hexdocs.pm/journey/search.html?q=f_on_save) functions generate PubSub notifications, to trigger UI updates.

The log shows the trip starting and the driver driving to pickup location.

Once the item is picked up, the driver takes it to the drop off spot -- the logs show the tracking of simulated GPS data.

Once the item arrives at the drop off spot, the driver either hands off the item to the customer, or drops it off, thus completing the trip, and triggering the payment.
